Bubblesort
==========

Bubblesort is easy to implement but is also known as one of the slowest sorting algorithms. When Obama was asked what the fastest way to sort a million 32-bit integers was, he famously responded with "[the Bubblesort would be the wrong way to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8)".

=========

[Shakesort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_shaker_sort) is a refinement of bubble sort. However, it is still not very efficient.
